A wide collection of beautiful, customizable page building blocks for the new Gutenberg editor in WordPress.

== Description ==

[GutenDev](https://gutendev.com/) is happy to announce that it just released [Sassy Gutenberg Blocks](https://gutendev.com/sassy-blocks/), the most dynamic Gutenberg block collection with lots of interactive customizable blocks. You can now design your sites in a new visual way that is light years ahead!

> Meet Sassy Gutenberg Blocks - The answer to all your needs when
> building your sites with most powerful features.

It all started when WordPress announced their new editor, Gutenberg; where you can find limited blocks to customize your sites. We thought of something out of the box that can manipulate your website like a charm. Even if you do not have the knowledge of writing a single line of code, you can now create the most synergistic website you can dream of. The Gutenberg Editor has some curtailments that can leg you behind building sites but with our new Sassy Gutenberg Blocks plugin, you can add almost anything you want on your site.
In the version 1.0.0, we are anticipating 15 new blocks with a number of new features that no other plugin has developed yet. In Sassy Gutenberg Blocks, you can now get the following blocks!
